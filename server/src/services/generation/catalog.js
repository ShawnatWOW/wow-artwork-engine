// orchestrator stays a thin coordinator. Two constants:
//   SPECS    — the exact pixel specs (mirrors migrations/002_seed_specs.sql /
//              Build Plan §4). The DB `specs` table remains source of truth;
//              this constant is what the media pipeline conforms to.
//   SURFACES — the generation targets for a week. Each expands into
//              `optionsPerSurface` (locked: 3) options.
